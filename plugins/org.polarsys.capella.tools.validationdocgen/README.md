## Generates capella validation rule documentation

### How do I generate documentation?

All you need to do is to import this plugin project into your workspace. The workspace must also contain the validation
documentation plugin org.polarsys.capella.validation.doc and the capella validation plugins. Then just run
the provided launch configuration *GenerateValidationRuleDocumentation* and refresh your workspace afterwards.
